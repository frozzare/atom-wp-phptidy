# Atom wp-phptidy package

Atom package of a modified version of [wp-phptidy](https://github.com/scribu/wp-phptidy) script.

This isn't publish on apm so install it with a git clone into `~/.atom/packages`.

## Usage

On Mac:
```
cmd-shift-l
```

It will override `editor:split-selections-into-lines`

# Other platforms 
I haven't test this on other platforms so it only supports Mac for now. But you can add it to your `keymap.cson` with the command `wp-phptidy:run`.

Feel free to contribute a solution!
